As a beginner to programming, Python originally seemed impossible. It would have been nice to have some concrete and simple examples to reference while learning this new language.

This portfolio will showcase some useful beginner Python code.

Included in this website, you will find code on:
Basic Python tools,
Manipulating, Merging and Managing DataFrames
Visualizations i.e. graphs

Here is an example of [reading in a csv file](reading_files.md)

Here are some basic examples of [creating functions](converting.md) 
Although the examples are not the most efficient use of Python, I gained an appreciation for functions and realized that functions are an incredibly useful tool in a variety of situations! 

Here are two ways of graphing data, using [matplotlib and seaborn libraries](Portfolio_work.md)
