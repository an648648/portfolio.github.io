Hi! Welcome to my website, created for my [Neural Data Science course (NESC3505)](https://dalpsychneuro.github.io/NESC_3505/). My name is Ani and I am in my third year of Neuroscience at Dalhousie University.

As a beginner to programming, Python originally seemed impossible. This portfolio will showcase some beginner Python code that I found extremely useful for this course.

## My website has coding examples and explanations for the following topics:

1. Basic Python applications
* a) reading in a csv file so that it can be manipulable and analyzable
* b) creating simple, muti-purpose functions so that data is easier to read and manipulate
2. Data Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborns libraries 
3. A Demo explaining the uses and applications of a mask


## Here are the links to my coding examples!

How to [read in a csv file](reading_in_csv.md).

How to [create simple and useful functions](creating_functions.md) 

How to [graph data using matplotlib and seaborn libraries](Portfolio_work.md).

In NESC3505, we are required to create Demos, to help others and learn from them.
My favourite Demo that I create was about [masking](https://an648648.github.io/demo-5/).

If you have any questions, please [email me](mailto:an648648@dal.ca).
