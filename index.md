Hi! Welcome to my website, created for my [Neural Data Science course (NESC3505)](https://dalpsychneuro.github.io/NESC_3505/). My name is Ani and I am in my third year of Neuroscience at Dalhousie University.

As a beginner to programming, Python originally seemed impossible. This portfolio will showcase some beginner Python code that I found extremely useful for this course. Happy coding!

## I have created examples and explanations for the following topics:

### Basic Python applications

How to [read in a csv file](reading_in_csv.md). 
Necessary files and packages must first be loaded to have a dataset to analyze, manipulate or modify.

How to [create simple and useful functions](creating_functions.md). 
Creating simple, muti-purposeful functions makes data manipulation much faster and more efficient. One function can be applied multiple times to different aspects of code.
  
### Indexing and slicing through lists and dataFrames

How to [index and slice lists and DataFrames](indexing_slicing.md). 
Accessing certain elements or a specific series of elements in a DataFrame is very helpful for visualizing pieces of information in a large DataFrame.

### Data visualizations using matplotlib and seaborns libraries

How to [graph data using matplotlib and seaborn libraries](matplotlib_seaborn.md). 
Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries allow beautiful graphs to be created, which is helpful for visualizing certain pieces of data within a DataFrame or array.

### Single unit data: creating Raster plots

How to [create a Raster plot](raster_plot.md). 
Raster plots are common in Neuroscience as they plot the frequency of action potentials over time. Note that this is **only for single unit (one neuron) data**

### 3D MRI slicing

How to [slice through a 3D MRI image](mri.md). 
Creating subplots of brain slices from a DICOM file is a cool way to show multiple 3D MRI images.

### Plotting cumulative distribution porbabilities

How to [plot CDFs](statistics.md). 
A CDF plot can be used to visualize the difference between an empirical (observed) cumulative function probability and a theoretical normal cumulative function probability.

### Demo explaining the uses and applications of a mask

In NESC3505, we are required to create Demos, to teach our classmates something about coding and to learn from them.
My favourite Demo that I created was about [masking](https://an648648.github.io/demo-5/).
