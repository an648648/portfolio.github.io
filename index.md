# Welcome to Ani's Portfolio

## A place to display my coding skills

More about me and what you will find in this website [here](https://github.com/an648648/portfolio.github.io/blob/main/background.md)

Here is an example of [reading in a csv file](https://github.com/an648648/portfolio.github.io/blob/main/reading_in_a_file.ipynb)

Here are some basic examples of [creating functions](https://github.com/an648648/portfolio.github.io/blob/main/creating_functions.ipynb) 
Although the examples are not the most efficient use of Python, I gained an appreciation for functions and realized that functions are an incredibly useful tool in a variety of situations! 

Here are two ways of graphing data, using [matplotlib and seaborn libraries](https://github.com/an648648/portfolio.github.io/blob/main/data_visualizations.ipynb)
