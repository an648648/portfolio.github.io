Hi! Welcome to my website, created for my [Neural Data Science course (NESC3505)](https://dalpsychneuro.github.io/NESC_3505/). My name is Ani and I am in my third year of Neuroscience at Dalhousie University.

As a beginner to programming, Python originally seemed impossible. This portfolio will showcase some beginner Python code that I found extremely useful for this course.

## My website has coding examples and explanations for the following topics:
```python
s = "1. Basic Python applications"
print s
```
2. Manipulating, Merging and Managing DataFrames
3. Data Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborns libraries
4. 

## Here are the links to my coding examples!

Here is an example of [reading in a csv file](reading_files.md)

Here are some basic examples of [creating functions](converting.md) 
Although the examples are not the most efficient use of Python, I gained an appreciation for functions and realized that functions are an incredibly useful tool in a variety of situations! 

Here are two ways of graphing data, using [matplotlib and seaborn libraries](Portfolio_work.md)

In NESC3505, we are required to create Demos, which are based on Silicon Valley workflows. I learned a lot from my classmates' Demos and I hope they learned something from mine as well! [Here](https://an648648.github.io/demo-5/) is a Demo I created about masking.

If you have any questions, please [email me](mailto:an648648@dal.ca).
